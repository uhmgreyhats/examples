# Exploiting

Here's my thought process for web exploitation
1) nmap --> What's open?
2) Subdomain brute force
3) Path brute force & /robots.txt
4) Are there input boxes? Possible injection
5) Does the input stay on the page? XSS
6) Does it look like theres a database? SQL Injection
7) Is there a ? in the url? Query String Injection

Here's my thought process for shell exploits (when given a ip and port)
1) netcat it --> What did it say/What happens?
2) What does it look like we have to do? Break it or exploit it
3) Buffer overflow
4) Try Empty Characters, NULL Character Input, ... etc
